Lately I've been runnung into the issue of time management. Because it's my first semester of uni it's hard to keep track of what you exactly need to do when nobody is there to tell you what,when and how you need to do your projects and studyings.So I Talked to one of the TAs about it and he had some interesting points. The TA said that there is no need to be stressed out
